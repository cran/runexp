Description: Implements two methods of estimating runs scored in a softball 
    scenario: (1) theoretical expectation using discrete Markov chains and (2) empirical
    distribution using multinomial random simulation.  Scores are based on player-specific input 
    probabilities (out, single, double, triple, walk, and homerun).  Optional inputs include probability
    of attempting a steal, probability of succeeding in an attempted steal, and an indicator of whether
    a player is "fast" (e.g. the player could stretch home).  These probabilities may be 
    calculated from common player statistics that are publicly available on team's webpages. 
    Scores are evaluated based on a nine-player lineup and may be used to compare lineups, 
    evaluate base scenarios, and compare the offensive potential of individual players.  
    Manuscript forthcoming.  See Bukiet & Harold (1997) <doi:10.1287/opre.45.1.14> for 
    implementation of discrete Markov chains.
